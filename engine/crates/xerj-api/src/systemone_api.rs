//! The local judge: System One wire-compatible decisions from a ladder.
//!
//! Two surfaces, one ladder:
//!
//! - `POST /v1/systemone` (native router) speaks TypeSafe's documented System
//!   One request/response shape, so a client written for their API —
//!   `jev-reranker`, the official SDKs — can point `TYPESAFE_ENDPOINT` at a
//!   XERJ node and keep working. Answers come from a weighted
//!   nearest-neighbour vote over a labelled-history index
//!   (`[decisions] index`), the retrieval analogue of a judge model that
//!   `benchmarks/decisions-as-retrieval` measures.
//! - `POST /_decide` (ES-compat router) is the same vote without the wire
//!   costume: it names its index per request and returns the neighbours,
//!   their labels and scores, and an abstain verdict.
//!
//! Nothing leaves the node. This module adds no outbound client; the vote is
//! an ordinary search against an ordinary index. That is the point of the
//! feature — the same interface, with the evidence staying home.
//!
//! # The decide ladder (#1057)
//!
//! Both surfaces answer through the same ordered ladder, per question:
//!
//! 1. **History vote** — when `[decisions] index` is configured and returns
//!    labelled support, the vote wins. It is the measured tier and it shows
//!    its evidence.
//! 2. **Local zero-shot head** (feature `decide-local`,
//!    `XERJ_DECIDE_MODE=local`, the env half of `--decide-mode local`) — a
//!    ModernBERT-class candle classifier ([`xerj_ai::decide`]) loaded from
//!    `XERJ_DECIDE_MODEL_DIR`. It answers every no-support outcome: no
//!    `[decisions] index` at all, a configured index that is missing, and a
//!    question whose payload retrieves no labelled neighbour. Its model echo
//!    is [`LOCAL_MODEL_ID`] — the same never-a-Jev-name discipline.
//! 3. **Hosted key** — reserved, not built. When tiers 1 and 2 cannot
//!    answer, the documented errors stand rather than a fabricated
//!    probability.
//!
//! The default build (no `decide-local`, or the mode unset) behaves exactly
//! as before: 503 with no `[decisions]` index, 422 `no_support` / on a
//! history that cannot answer.
//!
//! # The decision cache flywheel (#1061)
//!
//! Every tier-2 (and, when it is built, tier-3) answer is written back to
//! the `[decisions]` index as an ordinary document — the configured
//! `text_field`/`label_field` plus `p`, `source`, `ts` — so the answers a
//! node computes once become the history that answers the next request.
//! History-tier answers are not written: they ARE the index already, and
//! double-writing them would double-count their vote. The write-back is
//! spawned, never awaited by the request, and cannot fail it: a missing or
//! unwritable index is a log line, not an error the caller sees. Every
//! answer names its tier in a `source` field (`/_decide` top level,
//! `/v1/systemone` per-question in `decisions.evidence.*.source` — the same
//! string as `tier`, under the flywheel's name).
//!
//! Human corrections ride the same index: a history document carrying
//! `human: true` (written through the ordinary indexing API) is weighted
//! [`DecisionsConfig::human_weight`]× (default 2.0, the issue's ≥ 2x floor)
//! in the vote — see [`neighbour_weight`]. The weight is read in the vote
//! aggregation, so a correction outranks the cached answers it corrects.
//!
//! # The wire contract, and where we deliberately break it
//!
//! Request: `{ state, model, questions: { id: { type, instructions, criteria } } }`.
//! `state` may be a string or an object; question `instructions` may be a
//! string, object or array. **The vote text is payload data, never
//! instruction prose (#1000, #1001).** A question votes on exactly what it
//! points at: every `` `path` `` reference its instructions name — resolved
//! against the instructions' own string fields first (the data-field
//! pattern: `{"question": "Judge `document` …", "document": text}`) and then
//! against the state by dotted path (`` `documents.doc_0` ``, the shape
//! `jev-reranker` sends) — or, when it references nothing, on the state
//! alone: a string state whole, an object state by all its string leaves.
//! A reference that resolves to structure rather than text (the rubric
//! object `jev-reranker` ≥ 0.1.2 ships with its relevance preset) is
//! acknowledged and skipped: judge rules are not retrieval vocabulary.
//! References that resolve to nothing, and a payload with no text at all,
//! are 422s naming the question — never a confident vote on text the
//! question never saw. (These are request-shape refusals: the local head
//! does not rescue them, because there is no payload to classify.)
//!
//! Response: `{ model, answers, usage }` with `answers` keyed exactly by the
//! question ids sent and each answer carrying only its documented fields —
//! clients parse these strictly. Extras ride at the top level (`decisions`),
//! which every verified client ignores.
//!
//! Two deliberate breaks, both documented here and in docs/RERANK.md:
//!
//! 1. `model` is echoed as `xerj-history-vote-1`, never as a Jev model name.
//!    Echoing `jev-1.13.0` would claim these probabilities are the hosted
//!    model's. The requested name is reported as `decisions.requested_model`.
//!    When the local tier answered (all or part of the request), the echo is
//!    still `xerj-history-vote-1` for wire compatibility, `decisions.model`
//!    names the tier that answered each question per-question in
//!    `decisions.evidence.*.tier`, and `decisions.local_model` names the
//!    local head.
//! 2. A question with no support — an empty history, or no labelled
//!    neighbour — is a 422 naming the question ids. Zero support must not
//!    become a fabricated 0.5. (`/_decide` says the same thing as `abstain`.)
//!    The local tier is the documented exception: enabled, it answers those
//!    same questions with the head's probabilities instead.
//!
//! `score` questions (2–10 ordinal levels, weighted-average answer) have no
//! vote analogue and no benchmark: 422, in the docs.
