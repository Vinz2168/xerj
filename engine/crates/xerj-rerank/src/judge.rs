//! The local `judge` of `_search` — second-stage relevance scoring that never
//! leaves the node and never bills a token (issue #1060: "the zero-token
//! rerank").
//!
//! [`crate::Provider`] is the operator-pays arm: a hosted cross-encoder, one
//! outbound call per search, text off the node. This module is the other
//! option — a scorer that runs in process over the hits the response was
//! already about to return, so a caller can ask "how likely is THIS hit to
//! be relevant, as a number I can threshold" without paying for it or
//! exporting text. Each judged hit carries the probability as `_p_relevant`
//! (the hosted stage REPLACES `_score` with its probability; the judge
//! leaves the engine's `_score` alone and adds a field, so a client that
//! sorts by `_score` keeps seeing the engine's own number), and hits below
//! `judge.min_p` are dropped and counted in the response's `judged` block.
//!
//! # Honest scope: what the lexical scorer is, and is not
//!
//! The always-compiled arm, [`LocalJudge::Lexical`], is a DETERMINISTIC
//! LEXICAL scorer — window-local BM25 saturation over the judged page, IDF
//! computed from the page itself, mapped into `0.0..=1.0` by the maximum
//! attainable saturation (the formula and its provenance are on
//! [`lexical_scores`]). It is not a cross-encoder and has no semantic
//! signal: it re-reads the same words the first stage read, with page-local
//! statistics and an absolute scale the first stage does not offer. Whether
//! that beats the engine's own order is an empirical question with a written
//! bar — the BEIR gate in issue #1060 ("loses → does not ship": 0.699
//! SciFact / 0.345 NFCorpus beyond run spread, FiQA ≥ 0.30, harness at
//! `benchmarks/beir-hybrid`) — and NO quality claim is made here. What IS
//! claimed, and unit-tested, is: deterministic, bounded, and microseconds
//! for a top-30 page.
//!
//! [`LocalJudge::Model`] (cargo feature `judge-local`) is the semantic arm:
//! the node's local decision head — the candle NLI pair scorer landed in
//! `xerj-ai/src/decide.rs` for #1057 — scoring premise-=-document against a
//! relevance hypothesis and its negation. It is feature-gated exactly like
//! `decide-local` because it IS the same loader and the same model
//! directory: a node that armed `XERJ_DECIDE_MODE=local` has a judge model,
//! and a node without one uses the lexical arm and SAYS SO in the response's
//! `judged.scorer`. Model quality with the real trained checkpoint is
//! likewise unmeasured here: the gate binds at release, against the real
//! model.
//!
//! # Failure policy
//!
//! The lexical arm cannot fail. The model arm surfaces its failures
//! ([`RerankError::LocalModel`] → HTTP 503): a caller who asked for judged
//! hits and silently got unjudged ones has been misled, which is the
//! silent-fake class this crate refuses everywhere (see the crate header).
//! There is deliberately no degrade-to-lexical on a model fault —
//! substituting a different scorer than the one the response claims is the
//! same lie in the other direction.
